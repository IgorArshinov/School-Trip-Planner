# School-Trip-Planner
A full-stack mobile application that uses ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework, Xamarin and Universal Windows Platform. The main goal of this application is to try to achieve a clean architecture by implementing the model-view-viewmodel pattern. 

A teacher can use this application to plan school trips. A teacher can register himself on the Xamarin application and register toddlers on the UWP application. School trips can be planned on the UWP application. In the UWP application I used the MVVM Light Toolkit. In the Xamarin application I didn't use any frameworks to implement the MVVM pattern. To be able to scan a toddler's QR code I used the ZXing library.
